🎯✅ Create a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
🎯 Create a delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database.
🎯✅ Create a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
