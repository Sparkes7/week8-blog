## Requirements

🎯✅ Display all posts on the page, with an option to sort them in ascending or descending order.
🎯✅ Create a SQL schema for a posts table and a comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
Please submit your database schema, as is mentioned in the submission instructions.
🎯 Create a delete button on posts that allows users to delete the post from the database.
🎯 Create a form which saves comments to a dedicated comments table, with the comments being connected to the posts table with a foreign key.
🎯 Allow users to comment on individual posts in their dynamic routes. Comments should be associated with posts, and have a dynamic route (e.g. /posts/:postid).
🎯✅ Add a redirect when a user creates a post to redirect them to the posts page.
